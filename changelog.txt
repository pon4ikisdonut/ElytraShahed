Version 6.0.0 — Initial Release (Major)

Highlights:
- Introduced “Shahed” mode: become an Elytra kamikaze that explodes on contact with blocks/entities/fireworks.
- Added AA‑Gun crossbow with persistent tag and unbreakable flag.
- Implemented basic localization structure and startup logging.
- Removed experimental `/ghostfirework` command and its permission.
- Various polish and stability fixes.

Version 7.0.0 — Shahed Overhaul & Reactive System (Major)

Highlights:
- Added language switch (ru/en at launch) with `/elytrareload` to apply changes live.
- Introduced reactive boost item (default `NETHERITE_SCRAP`) for sustained mid‑air thrust while gliding.
- Fully removed the legacy `/ghostfirework` path; documentation and config updated accordingly.
- General cleanup across commands, README, and config.

Version 7.0.1 — Stability & Inventory Fixes (Patch)

Highlights:
- Prevented TNT helmet from being dropped/moved while Shahed is armed.
- Added a custom Shahed death message for clarity and fun.
- Final cleanup of ghostfirework remnants and permissions.
- Improved `/elytrareload` behavior and language handling; updated project metadata.

Version 7.0.2 — Minor Polish (Patch)

Highlights:
- Removed last traces of `/ghostfirework` and related messaging.
- Clarified the reactive feature in README and ensured item-only activation.

Version 7.1.0 — Localization Pack & Reactive Fix (Minor)

Highlights:
- Reactive boost now fires only when the configured item is held in the main hand; empty hands no longer trigger it.
- Added external language packs (ru, en, uk, pl, de, kk, es) in `plugins/ElytraShahed/lang`, loaded via `language` in config and refreshed with `/elytrareload`.
- Cleaned up legacy /ghostfirework remnants, refreshed docs/config comments, and tightened TNT bookkeeping for Shahed mode.
- Miscellaneous micro-optimizations around inventory checks and death handling.

Version 7.2.0 — Folia Scheduling & Crater Options (Minor)

Highlights:
- Folia-safe schedulers: AA‑Gun auto‑recharge and reactive boost now use entity/global region schedulers where available.
- New explosion options in `config.yml`:
  - `base-explosion-power` — base blast strength multiplied by Shahed scale.
  - `crater-mode` — `vanilla` (default) or `funnel` to carve a funnel-shaped crater.
  - `funnel-radius-per-scale`, `funnel-depth-per-scale` — tune crater size.
- Default language switched to `en` for fresh installs (existing configs unchanged).
